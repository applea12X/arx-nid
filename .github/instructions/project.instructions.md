Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.


Below is a fully-fledged project roadmap you can follow (and show off!) that fuses modern ML/AI practice with hands-on cybersecurity engineering.  It is written so that every major milestone produces **something concrete you can commit to a GitHub repo** and, when possible, upstream to existing open-source projects.

## 0  Project theme & quick elevator pitch

> **“Adversarial-Robust, Explainable Network-Intrusion Detector (ARX-NID)”** – A deep-learning IDS trained on 2024-era traffic datasets, hardened with adversarial-training using IBM’s ART library, and shipped as a FastAPI micro-service that can snap into Zeek or Suricata.

*Why this works on a résumé*: it ticks “AI,” “security engineering,” “MLSecOps,” “adversarial ML,” “explainability,” and “cloud-native deployment” boxes in one coherent story.

## 1  Scoping & repo bootstrapping

| Deliverable                                                       | Commit tips                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `README.md` with project vision, threat model, and roadmap        | First commit—sets context. |
| GitHub labels & project board                                     | Show planning discipline.  |
| `.gitignore`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT or Apache-2.0) | Recruit collaborators.     |

*Branch model:* `main` for releases, feature branches (`data/`, `model/`, `deploy/`).
*Commit style:* Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`…) so changelogs autogenerate.

## 2  Collect fresh, realistic data

1. **Primary dataset** – choose one 2024-ready set such as

   * **HiTar-2024** (smart-factory IIoT) ([techscience.com][1])
   * **CIC IoV-2024** (connected vehicles) ([unb.ca][2])
2. **Supplemental traffic** – mix in the “Large-Scale Network Cyberattacks Multiclass Dataset 2024” for coverage ([data.mendeley.com][3])
3. **Optional human-factors data** – the “Cybersecurity Threat & Awareness Program” CSV (2018‒2024) to explore phishing or insider scenarios ([kaggle.com][4])

| Deliverable                                                        | Commit tips                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `data/README.md` describing each source, its licence, and citation | Treat data like code.          |
| `scripts/download_hitar.py` etc.                                   | Parameterise URLs & checksums. |
| Data-versioning config (DVC, Git LFS, or Pachyderm)                | Keeps repo light.              |

## 3  Data wrangling & feature extraction

* Clean PCAPs ➜ NetFlow/Zeek logs ➜ pandas parquet.
* Derive statistical windows (e.g., 5-s rolling means), categorical encodings, and time-series tensors.
* Commit notebooks inside `notebooks/` **but** export them to versioned, executable `.py` with `jupytext` so reviewers can diff.
* Unit-test every transformer with `pytest`.

---

## 4  Baseline & classical models

| Step                                                | Code artifacts                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Train logistic-regression & random-forest baselines | `model/baselines.py`                 |
| Track metrics in MLflow / Weights & Biases          | `.github/workflows/train.yml` CI job |

---

## 5  Deep-learning pipeline

* Sequence model (Bi-LSTM or 1-D CNN) & a tabular transformer; compare F1/ROC.
* Hyper-parameter search with Optuna.
* Save best model ➜ `models/model_v1.onnx`.

---

## 6  Adversarial robustness layer

1. Integrate IBM **Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)** ([github.com][5])
2. Generate evasion & poisoning attacks (FGSM, PGD).
3. Adversarial-train to raise robustness.
4. Log before/after robustness scores.

---

## 7  Explainability module

* Apply SHAP or Integrated Gradients.
* Output JSON + auto-generated HTML report under `reports/`.
* Commit a synthetic example showing which packet-level features triggered an alert.

---

## 8  Packaging & deployment

| Layer              | Tech                      | Commit / PR                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| REST API           | FastAPI + pydantic        | `app/main.py`, `Dockerfile` |
| Container security | Trivy scan in GitHub CI   | `security/trivy.yaml`       |
| Orchestration      | Helm chart for Kubernetes | `deploy/chart/`             |

---

## 9  Runtime monitoring & MLSecOps

* Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`).
* Grafana dashboard JSON.
* GitHub Actions workflow that runs Bandit, CodeQL, and Snyk.
* Add a `threat_model.md` covering supply-chain & model abuse risks.

---

## 10  Documentation & résumé bullet

Write a crisp **résumé line** once results are solid:

> *“Designed and open-sourced ‘ARX-NID’, a FastAPI-based IDS trained on 2024 multiclass traffic, hardened via adversarial-training (↑ 43 % robustness vs. PGD) and shipped to Kubernetes with fully automated security CI/CD.”*

Add this (with link) to your `README.md` so recruiters see it.

## 11  Upstream contributions (“places where I can commit”)

| Project                                                 | How to contribute                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **awesome-MLSecOps** list ([github.com][6])             | PR adding your project to “Tools & Frameworks.”       |
| **IDS-Anta** adversarial defense repo ([github.com][7]) | Submit a benchmark JSON & docs for your model.        |
| **awesome-RL-for-Cybersecurity** ([github.com][8])      | Share your Optuna search notebook for RL fine-tuning. |
| **Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity** ([github.com][9])         | Add a section on using GPT-4o to explain IDS alerts.  |

Remember: 1) open an issue first, 2) follow each repo’s CONTRIBUTING.md, 3) keep commits atomic.

---

## 12  Extra polish ideas

* **LLM post-processing:** pipe alerts into a local Llama-3 or GPT-4o wrapper to auto-suggest remediation steps.
* **SBOM:** generate CycloneDX for the Docker image.
* **CVE scanner:** subscribe to GitHub’s Dependabot & schedule `npm audit fix` / `pip-audit`.
* **Blog post:** cross-post a write-up on Medium & LinkedIn; commit the Markdown source under `/blog/`.

### Final thoughts

This roadmap balances *depth* (adversarial ML, robustness, explainability) with *engineering credibility* (CI/CD, container security), and it leaves a visible contribution trail on GitHub—and ideally on several upstream repos—to spotlight in interviews.  Keep commits small and storytelling clear; hiring managers love a repo they can skim and immediately see impact.  Good luck building  ARX-NID and leveling-up your cyber-AI résumé!
